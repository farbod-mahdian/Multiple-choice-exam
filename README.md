WinForm C# Project

Users will see an instruction of how to do the exam, and then they can log in to the exam by entering their ID, username and password. After that the first question will come up, so the user can answer it and go for the next one. Each question has a specific time to answer, and if the user does not answer it during that period, the question will become disable, and the user only can click on the next button to see the next question. Also, there is progress bar in the windows form to show the user how many questions and time is left. At the end, the result of the exam will be shown in a new form which shows the grade as well as the wrong questions along with their correct answers to the user.
